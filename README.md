# Pre-Owned Car Price Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to build a machine learning model using Python to predict the prices of pre-owned cars. The objective is to create a tool that can assist users in estimating the fair market value of a used car based on various features.

## Features

- **Machine Learning Model:** The core of the project is the implementation of a regression model to predict car prices. Popular regression algorithms such as Linear Regression or Random Forest Regression may be employed for this task.

- **Python Implementation:** The entire project is implemented using Python, utilizing libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-Learn for data preprocessing, analysis, and machine learning.

- **Data Preprocessing:** The dataset will undergo preprocessing to handle missing values, scale numerical features, encode categorical variables, and perform other necessary transformations to make the data suitable for training the regression model.

- **Model Evaluation:** The model's performance will be evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared to ensure accurate predictions of car prices.

Dataset:
Obtain a dataset containing information about pre-owned cars, including features such as mileage, model year, brand, etc. Place the dataset in the data directory.

Run the Jupyter Notebook:
Execute the Jupyter Notebook Cars_Price_predition.ipynb to go through the entire project, including data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
